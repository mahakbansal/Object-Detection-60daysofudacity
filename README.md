# Wonder Vision
Object Detection Study Group for Facebook's Secure & Private AI Scholarship

June - August 2019


## Objective
This project is an undertaking by a coalition of students in Udacity's Secure & Private AI course. The objective is build a near real-time object detection pipeline. There are multiple implementations in this project each of which aims to addres a specific use-case. This repo is the point of origin for these projects which can be accessed via the links below.

#### _Group Links_
<links should be placed here>


#### _Weekly Meetings_
Virtual meetups are held via Zoom every Monday & Thursday at 7:00pm India Standard Time. [Find your local timezone here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20190723T133000&p1=tz_ist&p2=tz_et&p3=tz_gmt&p4=tz_pt)

## Guidelines
Each group should maintain a `REAMDE.md` file in the root directory of their repo. This will be a brief description of the group's objective, the dataset used, the model architecture, and an example of the use-case.

Notebooks are useful tools for breaking down how the code works and maybe useful for debugging. The final result of the projects should be a script (eg. `main.py`) which can be used to implement the example use-case. See [this page][1] for more tips on structuring a python project repo.
